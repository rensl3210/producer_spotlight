                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>My name is Rens, I am 18 years old and I come from Barneveld, a small town in the Netherlands. I have been producing and been part of this community for about 2 years now. I started my producing journey about 2 years ago in a program most are probably familiar with: <abbr title="Fruity Loops">FL</abbr> Studio. I started out making hip hop and trap beats, with my main influences being production giants Nick Mira and Rio Levya, who were making waves in those genres at the time producing for the likes of Juice WRLD and Lil Tecca. Later I started to branch out my style and started to produce house and drum and bass music. <strong>But through my production journey I have always maintained a passion for production and the community behind it.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Why Producers?</h2>
                    <p>Listening to music is something that is at the very least a small part of almost everyone's life. When someone ask what you are listening to you might say Drake, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish, Ed Sheeran etc. You might say: "I love Drake, his flow is great, his rhymes are solid and I love his beats." You might just love the way his music sounds in general. <strong>For most people, all the credit for an artists' music goes towards that artist. Meanwhile there are other people and often entire teams working hard to make the music sounds as good as it does.</strong> Writers, audio engineers and executive producers deserve an entire website of their own. Producer hover, are responsible for the largest part of the instrumentation of a track. The vocals of an artist making up the rest. By making beats and working together with artist in the studio, producer lay the groundwork for great music to made. Most often, beats set the mood and inspire the artist to take the track in a certain direction. </p>
                    <p>Through creating this website I want to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Bring more attention to the art of production,</li>
                        <li>Help producers monetize their work,</li>
                        <li>Connect producers together,</li>
                        <li>Allow producers to collaborate easily together,</li>
                        <li>Provide producers with the tools they need to level up their tracks,</li>
                        <li>And of course, highlight and support some awesome producers out there!</li>
                    </ul>
