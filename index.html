                    <h2><q>Hahaha, Nick you're stupid</q></h2>
                    <p>Nicholas Warren Mira is an American record producer from Cranberry Township, Butler County, Pennsylvania, who is part of the producer collective Internet Money, a record label he co-founded with fellow producer Taz Taylor. </p> 
                    <p>He gained notoriety for developing the sound of late rapper Juice Wrld, including the songs <cite>"Lucid Dreams,"</cite> <cite>"Bandit"</cite>, and <cite>"Smile"</cite>. He also worked with rapper Lil Tecca on "Ransom" and took a part in Internet Money's single <cite>"Lemonade"</cite>. </p>
                    <p>Nick first came in contact with producers Taz Taylor and DT through a Twitch stream in 2016, forming relationships with them based on their common method of selling and promoting their beats on platforms such as YouTube and SoundCloud. <strong>The trio proceeded to join forces in a collective label that would become what is now known as Internet Money, whose mission is to bring awareness to lesser known producers while uniting them with potential collaborators and artists. Much like what we try to achieve using our website.</strong></p>
                    <p>Nick explains the story behind his producer tag in an interview with Complex. He had had a competition for viewers to create a tag for him. Him and his girlfriend were judging the final tags when his girlfriend responded to a comment nick made laughing saying "Nick, you're stupid". Which nick would use in his tracks.</p>

                    <h2><q>Woah, Kenny</q></h2>
                    <p>Kenny Beats was born and raised in Greenwich, Connecticut. He has been studying music since the age of 9 when he started playing the guitar, playing drums since the age of 11, and producing music since his sophomore year of high school.</p>
                    <p>His first guitar was a Fender Stratocaster and his first amplifier was a Fender Hot-Rod Deluxe. During his junior year at Greenwich High School, he was able to enter a national electronic-music competition hosted by the National Association for Music Education and the National School Boards Association. <strong>Kenny won second place in the competition, which motivated him to start taking music production seriously.</strong></p>
                    <p>Kenny's production style varies. He plays piano, bass guitar, electric guitar and drums and often implements live instrumentation into his instrumentals, whether it performed by him or from a fellow instrumentalist.</p>
                    <p>Aside from his classic trap productions also explores more versatile instrumentation, tempos, production styles etc. such as with the likes of the more laid back and instrumental approach of songs such as singer Dominic Fike's <cite>"Phone Numbers"</cite> which contains a live guitar sample and a more acoustic feel. Another style of his production leans to a more experimental sound, found within his collaborative project with rapper Denzel Curry, Unlocked which contains many spoken word samples scattered throughout the tracks and a more disjointed feel, provided by various creative implementations of obscure musical samples found throughout the project.</p>
                    <p>Kenny's tag is a quick <q>Woah Kenny!</q> spoken by frequent collaborator and rapper KEY! featured at the start of almost all of his songs.</p>

                    <h2><q>If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon shoot you</q></h2>
                    <p>Leland Tyler Wayne, known professionally as Metro Boomin, is an American record producer, record executive, and <abbr title="Disc Jockey">DJ</abbr>. He is known for his dark production style and its influence on modern hip hop and trap.</p>
                    <p>He is also notable in the music industry for his producer tags <q>If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you</q>, <q>Metro!</q> and <q>Metro Boomin want some more, nigga</q>, respectively spoken by frequent collaborators Future and Young Thug; additional collaborators include The Weeknd, Travis Scott, Drake, 21 Savage, Nav, and Gucci Mane. </p>
                    <p>Wayne has released the collaborations <cite>Savage Mode</cite> (2016) and <cite>Savage Mode II</cite> (2020) with 21 Savage, <cite>DropTopWop</cite> (2017) with Gucci Mane, <cite>Perfect Timing</cite> (2017) with Nav, and <cite>Double or Nothing</cite> (2017) with Big Sean.

                    <p>As mentioned, Metro does not have one single producer tag and often uses new ones recorded by his collaborators. His most popular one to date however, remains to be: <q>If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you</q> spoken by Future.</p>

                    <h2>The Pharrel four count</h2>
                    <p>Pharrell Lanscilo Williams, sometimes known mononymously as Pharrell, is an American singer, rapper, record producer. songwriter, and fashion designer. Alongside close colleague Chad Hugo, he formed the hip hop and R&B production duo the Neptunes in the early 1990s, with whom he has produced songs for various recording artists. In 1999, he became lead vocalist of the band <abbr title="No One Ever Really Dies">N.E.R.D.</abbr>, which he formed with Hugo and drummer Shay Haley. <strong>Williams has been widely referred to as one of the most influential and successful music producers of the 21st century, having had a significant impact on the sound of modern popular music.</strong></p>
                    <p>Williams released his debut solo album, <cite>In My Mind</cite>, in 2006. In 2013, he produced and was featured alongside T.I. on the song <cite>"Blurred Lines"</cite> by Robin Thicke and his song <cite>"Happy"</cite> was the lead single for the soundtrack of the film <cite>Despicable Me 2</cite>; both songs reached the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as other charts around the globe. <strong>In the same year, he was featured on Daft Punk's single <cite>"Get Lucky"</cite>, which won Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.</strong> His second album, <cite>Girl</cite>, was released in 2014.</p>
                    <p>While Pharrel does not have a typical tag like all the other producers in this week's spotlight, many people regard the 4 count repeat at the start of his songs as the signature he leaves on all of his beats. If your hear the first beat of a song repeat four times over before starting, know you are listening to a Pharrel track. </p>
